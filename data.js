    title:'Chipped “smart masks” that are traceable and trackable are the ultimate globalist control mechanism',
    subtitle: 'The mask reminds users when to wash it and checks if they’re wearing it properly. If too much carbon dioxide builds up inside, a phone alert reminds the wearer to catch a few breaths of fresh air. If the user forgets to put the mask on, the same phone app sends them a reminder to mask up. As three quarters of single-use masks end up in landfills or oceans, the WEF also touts the environmental benefits of the reusable face covering.'
